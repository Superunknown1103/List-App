1. First I initiated a git repository, although I did run into a mistake here and originally cloned the repository into the wrong directory, that is why I ask you please ignore the first 6 or 7 commits with names like blablabla. Sorry about that, those are commits from another test repository that got merged into the same git history file.

2. Then I created the file structure layout. I got the layout from a similar MVC project I did earlier this year with SQL.
